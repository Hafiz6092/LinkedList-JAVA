# Project
LinkedList class -
Individual Project
Designed and implemented a generic doubly-linked list data structure using Java, 
showcasing strong problem-solving skills and algorithmic proficiency. 
Utilized ecient and optimized algorithms for operations such as adding and removing elements from both ends of the list,
accessing elements by index, and searching for elements. 
Implemented an iterator for traversing the list, making it compatible with Java's Collection framework. 
The resulting implementation demonstrates attention to detail and a commitment to creating robust and flexible software solutions.
